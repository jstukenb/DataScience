# DataScience
This was a project I made in my Data Science class to scrape the first 10 pages of posts from r/DataScience and export the author, likes, and total_comments on the post.

I recently expanded it so that you could input which subreddit you wanted to scrape and add little command line prompts to help let you know if it is working or not.
